## Code

As you noticed, site is coded in Jekyll.

**Note: Don't load Google Analytics and Disqus codes while running locally.**

To run it locally, just clone it and run `jekyll` command:

    $ jekyll serve --watch

If you don't want to install Ruby and related stuff, see attached `Dockerfile` and run:

    $ docker build -t webelement/website .
    $ docker run -i -t --rm -v "$PWD:/jekyll" -w /jekyll -p 4000:4000 webelement/website:latest jekyll serve --watch -H 0.0.0.0

There are also shortcut scripts:

    $ ./docker-build.sh
    $ ./docker-run.sh

Alternatively, you can use existing Jekyll container [grahamc/jekyll](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/grahamc/jekyll/).
